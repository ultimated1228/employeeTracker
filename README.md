## Description
A command line application that allows employers to track their employees.  This application was created as a part of the UC-Irvine coding bootcamp. The following user story and acceptance criteria were provided:

### User Story

AS A business owner  
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company  
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business  

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input  
WHEN I start the application  
THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role  
WHEN I choose to view all departments  
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids  
WHEN I choose to view all roles  
THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role  
WHEN I choose to view all employees  
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to  
WHEN I choose to add a department  
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database  
WHEN I choose to add a role  
THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database  
WHEN I choose to add an employee  
THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database  
WHEN I choose to update an employee role  
THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database

</li><li>
Open up the db folder in a command line terminal. 
</li><li>
Run "mysql -uroot" add -p if you your mysql is password protected. 
</li><li>

</li><li>
Open the main folder in a command line terminal. 
</li><li>

</li><li>

</li><li>
